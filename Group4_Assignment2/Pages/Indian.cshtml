                Idlis and dosas are probably the most popular breakfast foods in India. Though they originated in South India, idlis and dosas have gained nation-wide recognition now.
                <br />
                <br />
                Steamed, puffy and delectable, Idli doused in the ever-so soothing sambhar sure makes for one of the nation's most favourite breakfast.It is not oily or greasy, yet it is considered to be one of the most delicious regional snacks. It is a popular street food, yet shares no infamous reputation of being unhealthy or calorie-laden.
                <br />
                <br />
                Dosas are not just a treat for your taste buds, but also light on your digestive system. Prepared from rice and lentils, dosa is fermented breakfast option, which makes it easy for your body to assimilate and digest it.Dosa is also a great source of healthy carbohydrates. Dosa and sambhar both are made from lentils, which provide a good amount of protein to your body.

                There are specific components of the Indian Thali which have a range of health benefits.
                <br />Chickpeas, for example, which are often used in vegetarian curries, are a great source of fibre, zinc, folate and protein, which makes them a healthy factor in a vegetarian Indian diet. Spinach and tomatoes, which are widely used in Indian cuisine, are also known superfoods, containing high levels of antioxidants, vitamins and minerals.
                <br />Likewise, many Indian sauces and accompaniments are vegetable based, such as Sag aloo (spinach) and Gobhi Aloo (cauliflower with potatoes) making them a healthy choice as the majority do not use cream or cheese.
                <br />The minty yoghurt dip raita, made from natural yoghurt, cucumber and mint, is a source of calcium and is a low fat alternative to sauces such as mayonnaise. Natural yoghurt is also often used to form curry sauces instead of cream or coconut milk.
                <br />Garlic features greatly in Indian cooking, which is said to be good for the heart, as do chillies, which are good for the immune system and metabolism.
                <br />Finally, Indian dishes often use vegetable, sesame and peanut oil rather than butter, which keeps them lower in saturated fat.

                Caution: The samosas are not healthy at all,the only benefit it provides is the emotional connect to Indians as they may get a quick nostalgia of their street food outings.

                The good thing is that most Indians do not eat samosas every day either but the Chai is still a must in lot of house-holds So here are the benefits of chai

                <br />1. Protect against free-radicals: For one thing, chai’s black-tea base is rich in powerful antioxidants that protect cells from free-radical damage.

                <br />2. Improves digestion: Black teas have also been found to positively impact gut bacteria, boosting strains that help improve metabolism and prevent bloating.

                <br />3. Helps keeps hormones balanced: Research has found that drinking black tea may even change the way women’s genes are expressed, helping balance hormones, reduce inflammation, and possibly prevent cancer.

                <br />4. Strengthens immune system: Consider the fact that chai is also blended with an array of antioxidant-rich spices, each one with some pretty powerful, science-backed healing traits of its own. Ginger, for one, is known to have anti-nausea properties, while also helping to reduce inflammation and strengthen the immune system. Cardamom and black pepper also have digestive superpowers, further boosting chai’s reputation as a potent stomach savior.

              "Roti is a whole wheat version of naan bread," says Lauren Minchen, MPH, RDN, CDN. It can be made from a variety of unrefined grains including millet, jowar, bajra, and whole wheat.
              <br />
              <br />It's always best not to overdo it on the bread basket, given how carb-heavy most Indian dishes can be. But if you can't knock the craving, opt for roti since it's easier to digest and more nutritious because of its healthier grain base.

                When you think of chickpeas, you probably first think of Middle Eastern food like hummus, but it's actually quite popular in Indian cuisine as well.

                <br />Kaufman suggests opting for chana masala, which is a high-protein, plant-based entrée made from a spicy chickpea base. Usually, you'll also find onions, ginger, garlic, and tomatoes in this dish.

                <br />Aside from protein, chana masala is high in fiber, which is essential for keeping you feeling full for longer.
                <br />Chickpeas are also a good source of manganese and folate, which help support bone development—and are so well-loved that we even curated these chickpea recipes!
